    "Our input data is simply vectors, and our labels are scalars (1s and 0s): this is the easiest setup you will ever encounter. A type of \n",
    "network that performs well on such a problem would be a simple stack of fully-connected (`Dense`) layers with `relu` activations: `Dense(16, \n",
    "activation='relu')`\n",
    "\n",
    "The argument being passed to each `Dense` layer (16) is the number of \"hidden units\" of the layer. What's a hidden unit? It's a dimension \n",
    "in the representation space of the layer. You may remember from the previous chapter that each such `Dense` layer with a `relu` activation implements \n",
    "the following chain of tensor operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "`output = relu(dot(W, input) + b)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Having 16 hidden units means that the weight matrix `W` will have shape `(input_dimension, 16)`, i.e. the dot product with `W` will project the \n",
    "input data onto a 16-dimensional representation space (and then we would add the bias vector `b` and apply the `relu` operation). You can \n",
    "intuitively understand the dimensionality of your representation space as \"how much freedom you are allowing the network to have when \n",
    "learning internal representations\". Having more hidden units (a higher-dimensional representation space) allows your network to learn more \n",
    "complex representations, but it makes your network more computationally expensive and may lead to learning unwanted patterns (patterns that \n",
    "will improve performance on the training data but not on the test data).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two key architecture decisions to be made about such stack of dense layers:\n",
    "\n",
    "* How many layers to use.\n",
    "* How many \"hidden units\" to chose for each layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next chapter, you will learn formal principles to guide you in making these choices. \n",
    "For the time being, you will have to trust us with the following architecture choice: \n",
    "two intermediate layers with 16 hidden units each, \n",
    "and a third layer which will output the scalar prediction regarding the sentiment of the current review. \n",
    "The intermediate layers will use `relu` as their \"activation function\", \n",
    "and the final layer will use a sigmoid activation so as to output a probability \n",
    "(a score between 0 and 1, indicating how likely the sample is to have the target \"1\", i.e. how likely the review is to be positive). \n",
    "A `relu` (rectified linear unit) is a function meant to zero-out negative values, \n",
    "while a sigmoid \"squashes\" arbitrary values into the `[0, 1]` interval, thus outputting something that can be interpreted as a probability."

    "* There's usually quite a bit of preprocessing you need to do on your raw data in order to be able to feed it -- as tensors -- into a neural \n",
    "network. In the case of sequences of words, they can be encoded as binary vectors -- but there are other encoding options too.\n",
    "* Stacks of `Dense` layers with `relu` activations can solve a wide range of problems (including sentiment classification), and you will \n",
    "likely use them frequently.\n",
    "* In a binary classification problem (two output classes), your network should end with a `Dense` layer with 1 unit and a `sigmoid` activation, \n",
    "i.e. the output of your network should be a scalar between 0 and 1, encoding a probability.\n",
    "* With such a scalar sigmoid output, on a binary classification problem, the loss function you should use is `binary_crossentropy`.\n",
    "* The `rmsprop` optimizer is generally a good enough choice of optimizer, whatever your problem. That's one less thing for you to worry \n",
    "about.\n",
    "* As they get better on their training data, neural networks eventually start _overfitting_ and end up obtaining increasingly worse results on data \n",
    "never-seen-before. Make sure to always monitor performance on data that is outside of the training set.\n"
