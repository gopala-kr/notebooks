    "The fundamental issue in machine learning is the tension between optimization and generalization. \"Optimization\" refers to the process of \n",

    "\n",
    "At the beginning of training, optimization and generalization are correlated: the lower your loss on training data, the lower your loss on \n",
    "test data. While this is happening, your model is said to be _under-fit_: there is still progress to be made; the network hasn't yet \n",

    "To prevent a model from learning misleading or irrelevant patterns found in the training data, _the best solution is of course to get \n",
    "more training data_. A model trained on more data will naturally generalize better. When that is no longer possible, the next best solution \n",
    "is to modulate the quantity of information that your model is allowed to store, or to add constraints on what information it is allowed to \n",
    "store. If a network can only afford to memorize a small number of patterns, the optimization process will force it to focus on the most \n",

    "is generalization, not fitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, if the network has limited memorization resources, it will not be able to learn this mapping as easily, and thus, in \n",

    "\"simplest\" one, the one that makes the least amount of assumptions. This also applies to the models learned by neural networks: given some \n",

    "of a network by forcing its weights to only take small values, which makes the distribution of weight values more \"regular\". This is called \n",
    "\"weight regularization\", and it is done by adding to the loss function of the network a _cost_ associated with having large weights. This \n",
    "cost comes in two flavors:\n",
    "\n",
    "* L1 regularization, where the cost added is proportional to the _absolute value of the weights coefficients_ (i.e. to what is called the \n",

    "the \"L2 norm\" of the weights). L2 regularization is also called _weight decay_ in the context of neural networks. Don't let the different \n",
    "name confuse you: weight decay is mathematically the exact same as L2 regularization.\n",
