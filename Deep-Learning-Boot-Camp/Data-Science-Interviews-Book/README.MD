# Data Science & Deep Learning Interview Preparation Book (free)


In this practical data science interview preparation hand- book , you will face challenging interview questions in Data Science, Statistical Machine Learning, Probability, Statistics and Deep Learning. I have dedicated countless hours after work assembling this booklet, hoping to help candidates excel at their data science interview.

This booklet contains numerous data science interview questions. The focus lies primarily on developing an understanding of the principles and concepts underlying practical data science. I have not chased mathematical harshness and pureness, but in its place emphasize prac- tical everyday use (for a more scientifically pure analysis, please refer to the bibliography). Although machine learning is applied in a very broad range of domains, this booklet focuses on the application in RTB, Ad-tech, User Retention, CyberSecurity, Quantitative Finance, Kaggle- competitions and Computer Vision.
